                        Well, I'm Hugo! I'm a Computer Science + Applied Math double major 
                        at the University of California, San Diego. I'm currently a junior and
                        am slated to graduate Spring 2027. I love problem solving and coming 
                        up with innovative solutions.

                        Who I am really depends on who <em>you</em> are. I can be a great thinker
                        and engineer, but I can also be a brother, son, friend, and many other things.

                        <h3>Some basics</h3>
                        <p>
                            I was born in Sweden and lived there half of my life. I still visit pretty
                            much every summer, and I speak Swedish fluently. In fact, I still have a 
                            summer house there, which I love to visit. It's got beautiful nature surrounding
                            it, some much needed greenery compared to California.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I moved to California when I was 11. My dad had gotten a job as a professor
                            at Stanford, and so we took the chance and moved. It was tough at first, learning
                            a new language and all, but I've grown to love it here. The people are kind, and 
                            the weather is amazing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've now moved from the Bay to study at UCSD. Truthfully, it's very similar
                            to NorCal in a lot of ways, but still meaningfully different in others. Something
                            I never knew I missed out on living in the Bay is the beauty of a sunset on the
                            horizon of the water.

                        <h3>So what do you do outside of class?</h3>
                        <p>
                            I love to play games, particularly puzzle games. I haven't really found
                            time to play much at college, but this is something I find time to do
                            during breaks and whatnot. My all-time favorite's gotta be Minecraft, but
                            some other ones I've played are Hollow Knight and Silksong. I also play
                            a bunch of variant Sudoku, which is a niche based on the classic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also play D&D! I started playing during sophomore year during the pandemic
                            and have been playing with the same group ever since. Looking back on it, that's
                            a really long time (we're approaching the five year anniversary soon!) and I'm
                            really glad we've managed to keep it up during college. We're currently on our
                            second large campaign, and that will probably wrap up within a year.
